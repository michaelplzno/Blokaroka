One of my first projects: an attempt to make bricks appear on top of the UI in Windows. The code is based on a project that is over 10 years old, and was designed for an older version of windows. If the project catches on, hopefully we can work together to make it a popular app.

Hit the ESC key to terminate the program, it is designed to appear on top of the Windows UI, so it has no window frame or X in the corner to close it. I'm hoping we can add a taskbar icon so that you can see it in the active list of programs on the side Windows bar of icons.

When the program is working correctly it will spawn a bunch of little bricks on the desktop you can play with virtually by dragging them and connecting them. Also it will save the layout of the bricks into a gamestate so if you run it again your setup will be reloaded. 

Check the issues section for a list of current known issues, and let me know if you would like to fix them. Thanks to our first contributor the game compiles on Visual Studio 2019, but there are more issues on the list!

If you would like to contribute, just let me know!

This project is now officially Open Source under GPL V2.0, It is my hope that we can build this up into something bigger, maybe even an open source engine for games played on top of the operating system UI. 

"Let this be a kiss to the whole world!"
